## 💡 About

This program randomly selects a Serbian verb and a pronoun (e.g., "ja", "ti", "on", "mi", etc.), and asks the user to conjugate the verb accordingly.

It checks your answer and gives immediate feedback — great for beginners learning Serbian grammar!

## 🛠 Features

- Covers regular Serbian verbs in infinitive ending in `-ti`
- Practices all six groups of pronouns (singular/plural, 1st/2nd/3rd person)
- Gives you the English meaning of the verb
- Supports UTF-8 for special characters like `č`, `š`, `ž`, etc.

## 🧪 Example
Group: 1s | Pronoun: ja | Verb: učiti
ja učiti
Type your answer: učim
✅ Correct!
The correct answer is: ja učim
By the way, učiti means: to study

## Hints

- Ja = verb - infinitive(ti) + "m"
- Ti = verb - infinitive(ti) + "š"
- On, Ona, Oni = verb - infinitive(ti)
- Mi = verb - infinitive(ti) + "mo"
- Vi = verb - infinitive(ti) + "te"
- Oni, One, Ona = verb - infinitive(ti)
    - if last letter is "a" = "aju" 
    - elif last letter is "i" = "e" 
    - elif last letter is "e" = "u"

📌 Note
This program only includes regular verbs for now. Irregular ones (like "kupovati") are excluded to keep conjugation logic simple.
